        <h2>The Story</h2>
            <blockquote>
                Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
                That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.
                They said,
                <q class="neighbors">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q>
                The farmer said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it,
                and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                <q class="neighbors">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q>
                The farmer again said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
                <br><br>

                The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
                The neighbors then said, <q class="neighbors">Oh dear, that’s too <mark class="bad">bad</mark>,</q>
                and the farmer responded, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
                The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
                and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg.
                Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="neighbors">Isn’t that great!</q>
                Again, he said, <strong><q class="farmer">Maybe.</q></strong>
                <br><br>

                The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
                and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <mark class="good">good</mark> or <mark class="bad">bad</mark> —
                because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or,
                you never know what will be the consequences of <mark class="good">good</mark> fortune.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p class="conclusion"><mark class="good">good</mark> and <mark class="bad">bad</mark> are just one perspective.
    Bananas are <mark class="good">good</mark> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <mark class="good">good</mark> for bananas.
    Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
